## 1. Profit Margin

Since the dataset does not include cost of goods sold (COGS), we estimate profit using a flat **24.5% gross margin**, based on Walmartâ€™s publicly reported values between 2023â€“2025.

- ðŸ“Š Gross Margin Range: 24.09% â€“ 24.88%
- ðŸ“Œ Source: Macrotrends.net â€“ Walmart Gross Margin Historical Data

```DAX
Estimated_Profit = [Total_Sales] * 0.245
